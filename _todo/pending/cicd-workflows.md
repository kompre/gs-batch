## Session Activity Log

### 2025-10-15: Phase 1 Implementation & Ghostscript Fix

#### Work Completed

**Phase 1: CI Workflow Implementation**
- ✅ Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- ✅ Configured test matrix (Python 3.12, 3.13)
- ✅ Added type checking job (mypy)
- ✅ Added build verification job
- ✅ All tests passing successfully

**Critical Issue Fixed: Ghostscript CI Failures**

*Problem Discovered:*
- Initial CI runs failed with "FILE NOT PROCESSED!" errors
- Snap-installed Ghostscript couldn't access temporary files
- Sandboxing restrictions prevented file operations in `/tmp`

*Root Causes:*
1. Snap confinement blocked access to pytest's temporary directories
2. No health check in CLI to detect misconfigured Ghostscript
3. Silent failures with unhelpful error messages

*Solutions Implemented:*

1. **CI Workflow Fix** ([.github/workflows/ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml:30-38))
   - Replaced snap installation with apt-get
   - Simplified: `sudo apt-get install -y ghostscript`
   - Removed complex download/extraction steps
   - No PATH manipulation needed
   - apt version has no sandboxing issues

2. **CLI Health Check** ([gs_batch/gs_batch.py](../gs_batch/gs_batch.py:431-501))
   - Added `check_ghostscript_available()` function
   - Runs at startup before processing files
   - Two-stage verification:
     * Command exists and responds to `--version`
     * Actual execution test (catches sandboxing)
   - Provides helpful error messages with troubleshooting
   - Detects snap issues and suggests apt alternative
   - Early exit with clear guidance

*Results:*
- ✅ All 10 tests passing on Python 3.12 and 3.13
- ✅ CI runtime: ~58 seconds per test job
- ✅ Files properly processed (no more "FILE NOT PROCESSED!")
- ✅ Better user experience with immediate feedback

*Commits:*
- `f399c07` - Fix test assertion for PDF size variations
- `d49aaf8` - Check Ghostscript return codes to detect failures
- `53aeb82` - Use Ghostscript 10.04.0 for CI testing
- `3a7362a` - Fix Ghostscript PATH issue in CI tests
- `824a994` - Fix CI Ghostscript installation and add health check

## Problem Analysis

### Current State
- No CI/CD workflows configured
- Manual building and publishing to PyPI
- No automated testing on PRs
- No guarantee that main branch reflects PyPI state
- Version management is manual

### Requirements
1. Automated testing on all changes
2. Automated PyPI publishing
3. Version synchronization between Git tags and PyPI
4. Security best practices (no API tokens)
5. Clear release process

---

## Strategy: Label-Triggered Release Workflow

### Core Principle
**PR label "release" triggers automated release on merge**

When you merge a PR labeled "release":
1. Workflow reads version from pyproject.toml
2. Creates Git tag matching that version (e.g., `v0.5.6`)
3. Builds the package
4. Publishes to PyPI
5. Creates GitHub Release with PR description as changelog

This ensures **main branch state = PyPI published version** after merge, with **zero manual steps**.

### Why This Approach?

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fully automated (no manual tagging needed)
- ✅ Zero risk of version/tag mismatch (reads from pyproject.toml)
- ✅ PR description becomes release notes (built-in changelog)
- ✅ Clear audit trail (label + PR + tag + release)
- ✅ One decision point: "Is this PR a release?" → Add label
- ✅ Works with existing workflow (manual version bumps in PRs)
- ✅ Can't forget to tag or typo the version

**Cons:**
- Release happens immediately on merge (can't delay)
- Requires good PR descriptions for meaningful release notes
- Need to remember to add "release" label before merging

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Continuous Integration Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Triggers:**
- Every push to any branch
- All pull requests

**Jobs:**

1. **Test Matrix**
   - Python versions: 3.12, 3.13
   - OS: ubuntu-latest (Linux)
   - Install Ghostscript
   - Run `uv sync`
   - Execute `uv run pytest`
   - Upload coverage reports

2. **Type Checking**
   - Run `uv run mypy gs_batch/`
   - Verify type annotations

3. **Build Verification**
   - Run `uv build`
   - Verify package builds successfully
   - Check wheel and sdist created

**Benefits:**
- Fast feedback on PRs
- Catch issues before merge
- Verify buildability

---

### Phase 2: Label-Triggered Release Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`

**Trigger:**
- Merged pull requests with label "release"

**Trigger Configuration:**
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]

jobs:
  release:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true && contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'release')
```

**Important:** The workflow only runs when:
1. PR is closed AND
2. PR was merged (not just closed) AND
3. PR has the "release" label

**Security: Trusted Publishing (OpenID Connect)**
- No API tokens stored
- GitHub authenticates directly with PyPI
- Token generated per-publish, expires immediately
- Requires one-time PyPI configuration

**Jobs:**

1. **Extract Version from pyproject.toml**
   - Parse version from `pyproject.toml`
   - Example: `0.5.6`
   - Create tag name: `v0.5.6`
   - Check if tag already exists (fail if yes)

2. **Create and Push Git Tag**
   - Create annotated tag with version
   - Push tag to repository
   - This becomes the release identifier

3. **Build Package**
   - Set up Python 3.12
   - Install `uv`
   - Run `uv build`
   - Creates wheel (.whl) and source dist (.tar.gz)
   - Store artifacts

4. **Publish to PyPI**
   - Use official action: `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1`
   - Publishes with Trusted Publishing (OIDC)
   - Generates digital attestations (Sigstore)
   - Atomic upload (all files together)

5. **Create GitHub Release**
   - Create release from the created tag
   - Include **PR title and description** as release notes
   - Auto-generate changelog from commits since last release
   - Attach build artifacts (wheel + sdist)
   - Mark as latest release

**Workflow Example:**
```bash
# 1. Create PR with version bump to 0.5.6 in pyproject.toml
# 2. Write good PR description (it becomes release notes!)
# 3. Add "release" label to the PR
# 4. Get approval and merge
# 5. Workflow automatically:
#    - Reads version (0.5.6)
#    - Creates tag (v0.5.6)
#    - Publishes to PyPI
#    - Creates GitHub Release with your PR description
```

---

### Phase 3: Version Guard Workflow (Optional)

**File:** `.github/workflows/version-check.yml`

**Trigger:**
- Pull requests targeting `main` branch

**Purpose:**
Prevent merging PRs without version bump

**Jobs:**

1. **Check Version Increased**
   - Compare version in PR vs main
   - Fail if version not increased
   - Optional: Allow bypass with label `skip-version-check`

**Benefits:**
- Enforces version bumps
- Prevents forgotten version updates
- Maintains discipline

**Drawbacks:**
- May be too strict for documentation-only PRs
- Requires version bump even for minor fixes

**Recommendation:** Start without this, add later if needed

---

## PyPI Trusted Publishing Setup

### One-Time Configuration

1. **On PyPI:**
   - Go to Account Settings → Publishing
   - Add new publisher
   - Select GitHub
   - Repository: `kompre/gs-batch`
   - Workflow: `release.yml`
   - Environment: leave blank (or use `release`)

2. **No GitHub Configuration Needed**
   - Workflow automatically uses OIDC
   - Permissions configured in workflow file

### Security Benefits
- ✅ No long-lived API tokens
- ✅ No secrets in GitHub
- ✅ Automatic token rotation
- ✅ Audit trail via GitHub logs
- ✅ Digital attestations for packages

---

## Release Process

### Standard Release Flow with Label Trigger

1. **Development**
   ```bash
   # Make changes in feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   # Make commits
   ```

2. **Update Version in PR**
   ```toml
   # pyproject.toml
   [project]
   version = "0.5.6"  # Increment from 0.5.5
   ```

3. **Create PR with Good Description**
   ```markdown
   Title: Release v0.5.6: Add CI/CD workflows

   ## Summary
   Adds GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and publishing.

   ## Changes
   - Add CI workflow for testing
   - Add release workflow with Trusted Publishing
   - Add automated tagging on merge

   ## Breaking Changes
   None
   ```

   **This description becomes your release notes!**

4. **Add "release" Label to PR**
   - In GitHub PR interface
   - Add label: `release`
   - This marks it for automatic release on merge

5. **Review and Merge**
   - CI runs tests
   - Code review and approval
   - **Merge to main**

6. **Automatic Publishing (Zero Manual Steps!)**
   - Workflow detects "release" label on merged PR
   - Reads version from pyproject.toml (`0.5.6`)
   - Creates Git tag (`v0.5.6`)
   - Builds package
   - Publishes to PyPI
   - Creates GitHub Release with your PR description

   **Done! Package is live on PyPI.**

### Versioning Guidelines

**Semantic Versioning (SemVer):**
- `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- `1.0.0` format

**When to Bump:**
- **MAJOR (1.0.0 → 2.0.0):** Breaking changes, incompatible API
- **MINOR (0.5.0 → 0.6.0):** New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH (0.5.5 → 0.5.6):** Bug fixes, no new features

**Pre-releases (Optional):**
- `0.6.0a1` - Alpha
- `0.6.0b1` - Beta
- `0.6.0rc1` - Release candidate

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create CI Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Features:
- Test matrix (Python 3.12, 3.13)
- Install Ghostscript
- Run pytest with coverage
- Type checking with mypy
- Build verification

### Step 2: Configure PyPI Trusted Publishing

**On PyPI:**
1. Log in to pypi.org
2. Go to "Publishing" settings
3. Add GitHub as trusted publisher
4. Configure: `kompre/gs-batch`, workflow `release.yml`

### Step 3: Create Release Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`

Features:
- Tag validation (matches pyproject.toml)
- Build wheel + sdist
- Publish with Trusted Publishing
- Create GitHub Release
- Upload artifacts

### Step 4: Documentation

**Update:** `README.md` or create `CONTRIBUTING.md`

Document:
- Release process
- Version bump guidelines
- Tag creation
- Testing locally before release

### Step 5: Test Release

**Recommendation:** Use TestPyPI first

Modify workflow to publish to TestPyPI:
```yaml
with:
  repository-url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
```

Test full cycle, then switch to production PyPI.

---

## Additional Considerations

### Build Tool: UV

The project uses `uv` for dependency management. Workflows will use:
```yaml
- name: Install uv
  uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v4

- name: Sync dependencies
  run: uv sync

- name: Run tests
  run: uv run pytest
```

### Caching

Enable caching for faster workflows:
```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-python@v5
  with:
    python-version: '3.12'
    cache: 'pip'
```

### Ghostscript Dependency

Tests require Ghostscript. Install in CI:
```yaml
- name: Install Ghostscript
  run: sudo apt-get install -y ghostscript
```

### Test Assets

Ensure test PDFs are committed to repo:
- `tests/assets/originals/*.pdf`

### Versioning in Code

Current implementation:
```python
from importlib.metadata import version
def get_version() -> str:
    try:
        return version("gs-batch-pdf")
    except PackageNotFoundError:
        return "unknown"
```

This works perfectly - reads from installed package metadata.

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. Automatic Semantic Versioning

**Tool:** python-semantic-release

**How it works:**
- Parses commit messages (Conventional Commits)
- Auto-bumps version based on commits
- `fix:` → patch, `feat:` → minor, `BREAKING CHANGE:` → major

**Pros:**
- Fully automated
- No manual version bumps

**Cons:**
- Requires strict commit message discipline
- Less control over releases
- Overkill for small projects
- Learning curve for contributors

**Decision:** Not recommended for this project. Manual control is better.

### 2. Version from Git Tags

**How it works:**
- Use `setuptools-scm` or similar
- Version derived from Git tags
- No version in pyproject.toml

**Pros:**
- Single source of truth (Git tags)
- No manual version updates

**Cons:**
- Complex setup
- Less transparent
- Harder to debug
- Non-standard approach

**Decision:** Keep version in pyproject.toml (current approach).

### 3. Publish on Every Main Push

**How it works:**
- Every merge to main publishes to PyPI
- Auto-increment version

**Pros:**
- Maximum automation

**Cons:**
- No control over release timing
- Can't batch fixes
- May publish broken versions
- Not recommended practice

**Decision:** Use tag-based releases for control.

## Success Criteria

After implementation:

1. ✅ CI runs on all PRs and pushes
2. ✅ Tests execute on Python 3.12 and 3.13
3. ✅ Type checking passes
4. ✅ Package builds successfully
5. ✅ Pushing version tag publishes to PyPI
6. ✅ GitHub Release created automatically
7. ✅ No API tokens stored in GitHub
8. ✅ Main branch state matches PyPI after tag
9. ✅ Process documented for contributors

---

## Rollback Plan

If publishing fails:

1. **GitHub Release:** Can be deleted manually
2. **PyPI Package:** Cannot be deleted (PyPI policy)
   - Must publish new patch version
   - Mark as yanked if critical issue
3. **Git Tag:** Can be deleted and recreated
   ```bash
   git tag -d v0.5.6
   git push origin :refs/tags/v0.5.6
   ```

**Prevention:**
- Always test builds locally first
- Use TestPyPI for validation
- Review changes carefully before tagging

---

## Timeline

**Total Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

- Phase 1 (CI): 1 hour
  - Create workflow file
  - Test on actual PR
  - Adjust for Ghostscript setup

- Phase 2 (Release): 1-1.5 hours
  - PyPI Trusted Publishing setup
  - Create workflow file
  - Test with TestPyPI
  - Do actual release

- Phase 3 (Documentation): 30 minutes
  - Update README or CONTRIBUTING.md
  - Document release process

---

## Questions to Address

1. **Should we add version-check workflow?**
   - Recommendation: Start without, add if needed

2. **Test on Windows/macOS in CI?**
   - Current: Linux only
   - Recommendation: Add later if issues arise

3. **Code coverage requirements?**
   - Current: No enforcement
   - Recommendation: Track but don't block

4. **Branch protection rules?**
   - Require CI to pass before merge
   - Recommendation: Yes, add after CI works

- ✅ Tests passing on Python 3.12 and 3.13
- ✅ Type checking and build verification working
- ✅ Ghostscript health check implemented

### Remaining Work

#### 2.1 PyPI Trusted Publishing Setup (User Action Required)

**On PyPI (pypi.org):**
1. Log in to your PyPI account
2. Navigate to Account Settings → Publishing
3. Add new trusted publisher:
   - Publisher: GitHub
   - Owner: `kompre`
   - Repository name: `gs-batch`
   - Workflow filename: `release.yml`
   - Environment name: (leave blank or use `release`)

This is a **one-time setup** that enables secure publishing without API tokens.

#### 2.2 Create Release Workflow

**File to create:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`

**Workflow will:**
1. Trigger on merged PRs with "release" label
2. Extract version from `pyproject.toml`

4. Build package with `uv build`
5. Publish to PyPI using Trusted Publishing (OIDC)
6. Create GitHub Release with PR description as changelog
7. Attach build artifacts to release

**Key Features:**
- Label-triggered (add "release" label to PR before merging)
- Zero manual steps after merge
- PR description becomes release notes
- Automatic tag creation from version
- Digital attestations via Sigstore

#### 2.3 Create CONTRIBUTING.md

Document the release process:
- How to bump version in `pyproject.toml`
- How to write good PR descriptions (they become release notes!)
- How to add "release" label
- Versioning guidelines (SemVer)
- Troubleshooting section

#### 2.4 Test Release Flow

**Recommendation: Test with TestPyPI first**

1. Modify `release.yml` to use TestPyPI:
   ```yaml
   repository-url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
   ```
2. Create test PR with version bump
3. Add "release" label
4. Merge and verify workflow
5. Check package on test.pypi.org
6. Switch to production PyPI

#### 2.5 First Production Release

Once tested:
1. Create PR with real version bump
2. Write comprehensive PR description
3. Add "release" label
4. Merge to main
5. Monitor workflow execution
6. Verify package on PyPI
7. Test installation: `pip install gs-batch-pdf`

### Estimated Time
- PyPI setup: 10 minutes
- Release workflow creation: 1 hour
- Documentation: 30 minutes
- Testing (TestPyPI): 30 minutes
- First release: 30 minutes

**Total: ~2.5 hours**

### User Decisions

1. **PyPI/TestPyPI Setup:** ✅ TestPyPI configured and ready
2. **Test approach:** ✅ Test with TestPyPI first
3. **Branch protection rules:** ✅ Yes, enable after testing
4. **Version-check workflow:** ✅ Yes, implement it (Phase 3)
